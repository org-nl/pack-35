                </div>
                <p>Casino offers a selection of games to suit all tastes and preferences. Whether you are a fan of ambitious adventures, strategic betting or treasure hunting, there is something for everyone. Here are three of the best games you can enjoy at Betpawa UG Casino:</p>

                <div class="game-section">
                    <h3>Aviator</h3>
                    <p>Aviator is a game that takes players on a high altitude adventure. It is unique in its simplicity and excitement. In Aviator you place a bet and watch as the aircraft takes off and begins its flight. The longer the aircraft stays in the air, the higher your potential winnings. However, the challenge is to cash out before the plane flies away. This is a game that requires time and nerves, as waiting too long can result in losing your bet if the plane disappears.</p>
                    <p>The key to success at Aviator is deciding when to cash out. You can over-cheat by exiting early for a smaller profit, or you can take a bigger risk for a bigger reward. This balance of risk and reward makes Aviator an attractive choice for users who want fast and fun gameplay.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="game-section">
                    <h3>JetX</h3>
                    <p>JetX offers a similar adrenaline rush to Aviator, but with its own unique features. In JetX, players place bets on how high the virtual aircraft will fly. As the plane gains altitude, the multiplier increases, representing a potential payout. You must pick the perfect moment to cash out before the plane crashes, and take your bet with you if you wait too long. Understanding the patterns and having a sense of timing can increase your chances of cashing out at the right time.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="game-section">
                    <h3>Fortune Miner</h3>
                    <p>Fortune Miner sends you on a treasure hunting expedition deep in a mine, where treasure awaits those who dare to explore. You navigate through the mine, collecting treasure and avoiding obstacles. The game features attractive graphics and exciting sound effects that will make you feel like a real miner looking for luck.</p>
                    <p>The goal is to collect as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps. The game rewards careful planning and quick reactions as you decide which path to take and how to maximise treasure extraction. It is ideal for users who enjoy the combination of action and strategy with a favourable payout structure.</p>

                <p>Decimal odds indicate how much you will win for every 1 unit bet. And here is an explanation of some of the most popular betting markets:</p>

                <div class="columns-container">
                    <div class="column">
                        <ul>
                            <li>A bet on whether the total number of goals will be more (More) or less (Less) than a specified number. For example, if the line is set at 2.5 goals, a "Over" bet wins if three or more goals are scored, and a "Under" bet wins if two or fewer goals are scored.</li>
                            <li>A bet on whether both teams will score in the match. "Yes" means that both teams will score at least one goal, and "No" means that at least one team will not score.</li>
                            <li>A bet on the exact score at the end of the match. In cup competitions "full time" means the score after 90 minutes, excluding extra time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <ul>
                            <li>A bet on a particular player to score. The possible options are: "Author of the first goal", "Author of the last goal", "Author of the goal at any time", "Base" (two goals) and "Hat-trick" (three goals). Auto goals are not taken into account in bets on the author of the first and last goal.</li>
                            <li>Betting on the result after applying a handicap. For example, in a match between Manchester City and Burnley, a bet on "1 (Home -4)" means you expect Manchester City to win by more than four goals, and "2 (Away +4)" means you expect Burnley to win. or lose by less than four goals.</li>
